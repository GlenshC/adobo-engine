//todo ecs and texture should support manual uvs and not just a uv_index
//todo binary asset compiler must output a enum for accessing the assets

//TODO add suport for ggb::AssetAtlas texture
//TODO change sprite.vert to support texture uvs
//TODO add ecs set uv_index or something that will calculate the texture uv on the fly 


todo utilize compute shaders to our advantage
TODO add tooling that aids making scenes or like placing out the objects

todo make default coord system from 0 - SCREEN_WIDTH/HEIGHT to 0.0f - 1.0f

make a mem system
implement editor gui, json loader for loading assets and scene creator
might think of a runtime game loader instead of a raw code to help game dev to be faster
loads data like entities, type of entities, position, scale
and code is just the behavior of such entities
