//todo ecs and texture should support manual uvs and not just a uv_index
//todo binary asset compiler must output a enum for accessing the assets

//TODO add suport for ggb::AssetAtlas texture
//TODO change sprite.vert to support texture uvs
//TODO add ecs set uv_index or something that will calculate the texture uv on the fly 
// IMPLEMENT ALL OF THE SHIT AS DYNAMICALLY ALLOCATED SHIT
// SPRITE2DSOA
// TextureSoa now TextureManager
//todo make default coord system from 0 - SCREEN_WIDTH/HEIGHT to 0.0f - 1.0f
//reimplement all static gloval variables.


todo utilize compute shaders to our advantage
TODO add tooling that aids making scenes or like placing out the objects


make a mem system
implement editor gui, json loader for loading assets and scene creator
might think of a runtime game loader instead of a raw code to help game dev to be faster
loads data like entities, type of entities, position, scale
and code is just the behavior of such entities

!!!!!!!
IMPORTANT!!!!
Atlases (xml) should and can be loaded at runtime without prior binary processing and
in the editor we compile this to binary or in a saved game scenes for later editing
MULTI ASSETS (images, shaders, atlases, xml) and runtime loading of new assets

but only one bin;
bins can be edited and processed again but we should make this the last thing to implement;
in order to allow to process this again we need metadata like a json file to know the names of this files

WITH EDITOR IN HAND we should have:
scene file format where names and types of the entities can be placed
this will later be processed to become a binary compiled asset other than glnsh binasset
glnsh binasset only should contains the assets files and never game stuff like position types etc
binasset should then store names as this is a intermidiary file type but more thoughts on that soon

saving and loading scenes.
make a file format for scenes
editor gui.


FOR now we do editor then later 
we implement runtime loading of assets in the editor and
compile runtime assets to binasset or some intermidiary file for later processing

BINASSET MAKE OUTPUT OF WRITER NORMAL TEX UV FOR ATLAS SUBTEX
