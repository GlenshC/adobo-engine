IMPORTANT!!!!
might think of a runtime game loader instead of a raw code to help game dev to be faster
loads data like entities, type of entities, position, scale
and code is just the behavior of such entities

Atlases (xml) should and can be loaded at runtime without prior binary processing and
in the editor we compile this to binary or in a saved game scenes for later editing
MULTI ASSETS (images, shaders, atlases, xml) and runtime loading of new assets

but only one bin;
bins can be edited and processed again but we should make this the last thing to implement;
in order to allow to process this again we need metadata like a json file to know the names of this files

WITH EDITOR IN HAND we should have:
scene file format where names and types of the entities can be placed
this will later be processed to become a binary compiled asset other than glnsh binasset
glnsh binasset only should contains the assets files and never game stuff like position types etc
binasset should then store names as this is a intermidiary file type but more thoughts on that soon
